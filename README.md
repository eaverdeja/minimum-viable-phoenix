# Minimum viable Phoenix

> Phoenix ships with quite a few bells and whistles. Whenever you fire up mix phx.new to create a new web application, forty six files are created and spread across thirty directories!

> This can be overwhelming to developers new to Phoenix.

> To build a better understanding of the framework and how all of its moving pieces interact, let’s strip Phoenix down to its bare bones. Let’s start from zero and slowly build up to a minimum viable Phoenix application.
